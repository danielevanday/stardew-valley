meadowland deviations 
- day 3, don't need to buy as much bait since rushing baitmaker. can keep some fish to sell later if room. maybe 300 bait to be safe?
- day 3, feed chickens and harvest eggs
- day 4, grab eggs (carrots also spawned) --- should i chop extra wood for scarecrow? yes ithink
    - actually skip, can grab on next rainy day. chickens should have 2 hay left
- day 5, 300 wood from robin on way to clint?
  - normal mining run
    - go to robin for 300 wood before clint
    - move coop if space avaialble to be closer to house
    - after clint go to pierres to buy seeds
    - after pierre, go to beach, fix bridge, forage, them head back to farm and proceed as normal
    - during the run, peek the tide pool area from the beach in the first few days. if you see a sea urchin and a coral, you have decent odds to go on friday, if not. you can try saturday to maximize the amount of foragables 
  - harvest 4 chicken egg, place 2 more hay in trough. eggs are 5 exp ea (need to verify)
  - practice run ---  8/280 exp for lvl 2. Need 272 exp. 16 kale needed at 17 exp ea
      - 10 gold ore, 37 iron ore
  - spring 8. ship for gold pick and half kale seeds
  - spring 9 move coop
      - cant move coop spring 9 bc robin is at class
  -next pivot, spring 10, don't ship for 2nd batch of kale
- spring 13, ship 42.5k to fix boiler room next day. this heavily relies on getting 2 rainy days after the bait maker
- spring 14 - bundles
- need to get green bean a day earlier 
  - day 1 cauli is super important 
- spring 14 - if you plan on passing out, ship 500 g worth of items for bus ticket, or alternatively, sell to pierre in the morning on spring 15
- spring 15 - made it to desert festival. goal is to buy as many strawberry seeds as possible
  - scouted shops for maru - checked opening times, did pam bus stop trick. only mines were open - probably need to leave at 12 am to get to the scholar and gil and trader
  - get food buff, does stack with other foods. bring ruby and diamond and omni geodes to trade
  - pam arrives at 8:50, spend time clearing for sprinkers for strawberrys
  - buy however many strawberry seeds you think you can handle. remember you will need to harvest and clear on the 28th to make room for upgraded sprinkers 
  - leave at 11 pm to buy things and have enough time to go back and plant strawberries and place sprinklers
- 16 and 17 - can scout if you want for shops. demetrius is great for delux speed grow.
  - getting a bad day here means you can proceed with clearing your farm and upgrading axe 
  - otherwise buy magic rock candy for 70 egg
  - spring 17 bought 100 deluxe speed grow from demetrius
